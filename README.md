# CONTENT API GATEWAY

V 0.0.2

## Overview

The content gateway dynamically directs incoming API calls to specific microservices, ensuring efficient routing and returning the [defined result](#result). Service definitions are specified in the `services.json` file. Currently, [adding a new Services](#adding-services) requires manual entry into the `services.json` file.

### Adding Services

To add a new service to the Gateway, follow these steps:

Open the services.json file in the root of your project.

Add a new entry for your service, specifying the necessary details such as path, title, method, serviceInstance, command, curl, and transformations.

### Example Service
```
{
   "path": "many_requests",
   "services": {
       "one": {
           "title": "grab what",
           "method": "GET",
           "serviceInstance": "axios",
           "command": "content",
           "curl": "internal",
           "transformations": {
               "output": "xlsx"
           }
       }
   }
}
```
